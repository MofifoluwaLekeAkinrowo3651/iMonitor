### The iMonitor app is an app that shows the uses of IoT sensors (Ultrasonic HC-SR04 and Pressure BMP280) and appications and how these devices can aid easy control over our everyday devices in order to make our lives easy. These devices can used in a commercial or residential environment. These devices can be controlled once connected through the app with switches allowing you to turn off all devices in a room in the building all at once or selectively.


### The app starts off with a splash screen that will display the app logo. Following this splash screen is some onboarding screens to give a quick brief of the app.
### Then we have a Login Screen for the user, prompting their login details to be able to access devices. Once logged in, there is an overview of all rooms in building which include switches on them to turn off all devices in selected room at once. One can also tap specific room to control specific devices in each room.
### There are 3 menu bar buttons; Overview, Review and Settings.
