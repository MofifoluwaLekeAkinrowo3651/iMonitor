### The smart building app is an app that is aimed to help save on electricity, and allow easy control over devices used in commercial or residential buildings. These devices can be controlled once connected through the app with switches allowing you to turn off all devices in a room in the building all at once or selectively.
### The app starts off with a splash screen that will display the app logo. Following this splash screen is some onboarding screens to give a quick brief of the app.
### Then we have a Login Screen for the user, prompting their login details to be able to access devices. Once logged in, there is an overview of all rooms in building which include switches on them to turn off all devices in selected room at once. One can also tap specific room to control specific devices in each room.
### There are 3 menu bar buttons; Overview, Events and Settings. The events page (bell button) shows actions made by user i.e. if user turned off lights, the events page will report such action. The settings page has options to send notifications from app, and to report technical issues or suggest new features.
### Bug: When running app on emulator, upon clicking on app you recieve a toaster message, "App isn't installed". Yet to be fixed.
### In order to access app, tap and hold app -> App Info -> Open.
